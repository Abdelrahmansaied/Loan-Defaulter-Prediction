The bank is involved in money lending business. When the bank receives a loan application, the bank must decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
      • If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
      • If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e., he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company. Both cases result in a loss to the bank.
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected..
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables which are strong indicators of default.
